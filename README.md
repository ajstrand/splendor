gleam frontend library using [gleam vdom](https://github.com/JohnDoneth/gleam-vdom)

## This is a work in progress, not useful yet as the gleam vdom library included needs updating and is missing core features

## Quick start

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
gleam shell # Run an Erlang shell
```

## Installation

If available on Hex this package can be added to your Gleam project:

```sh
gleam add test_project
```

and its documentation can be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/test_project>.
